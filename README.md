Adds webadmin tabs to more easily change the server settings. This includes: 
 
 - Settings in the settings.ini 
 - Settings in every world's world.ini 
 - Uploading new plugins through the webadmin 


If settings are not relevent they are not shown. For example you won't see settings for villages if the world does not have villages enabled.

A list of all the changes can be reviewed before applying them.
